# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About Application

This is a fun little movie application where you can search for a movie and add them to the watchlist, remove or move them to the watched list. We are using the movie database API to search the movie and display on the UI.

## Technologies used

1. React JS
2. Context API for global state and localStorage for persistance
3. TMDB movie database API with axios to query our movie search
4. Netlify for automatic deployments
